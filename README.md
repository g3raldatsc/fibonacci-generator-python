# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

A Python program that generates the Fibonacci sequence and displays it with a simple animation in the terminal.  
The program shows each number in the sequence one by one, creating a visual effect as it progresses.

---

## Description
The **Fibonacci sequence** is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

This program allows the user to specify how many terms of the sequence to generate.  
Each number is displayed sequentially with a short delay to simulate an animation effect, making the output dynamic and easier to follow.
